### What Is This Directory For?

You should place your Windows image in this folder named `Windows_11.iso`.  
If you want to use any other name, change `iso_url` in the corresponding `.hcl` file.

If you are configuring this for use of a retail key and using a retail ISO, you need to uncomment the <ProductKey> block in the Autounattend.Base.xml and include the correct ProductKey.
